# The ic intensional compiler

## This is the master branch. The latest branch is the `types` branch which contains a rewrite of the compiler and runtime to support types  

## Process

The process of compilation is:

1. Parse the functional program
2. Transform the functional program to a high level intermediate representation
3. Compile the HIR to the intensional program
4. Compile the intensional program to C
5. Compile the C program to an executable and link it with the runtime library

## Roadmap

### Compiler

- [X] Parse functional programs as shown in `prog.fl`
- [X] Peform error checking on the functional program (undefined variables, wrong argument arities, definition of nullary variable `result`, etc.)
- [X] Handle function local arguments in the functional source program
- [X] Transform the functional program to a high level intermediate representation
- [X] Transform the HIR to the equivalent intensional program
- [X] Compile the intensional program to C
- [X] Don't require the user to compile and link the generated code; do it automatically
- [ ] Compiler code is ðŸ’© needs cleanup/simplification

### Runtime

- [X] LARs (Only heap allocated, will change if types are added to the language)
- [X] Garbage Collection (Currently mark and sweep - pretty slow should be improved)

## Dependencies

- The Rust toolchain (<https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>)

- GCC (<https://gcc.gnu.org/install/>)

- CMake (<https://cmake.org/install/>)

- Make (<https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>)

## Running a program

### Step 1: Cloning the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikos-alexandris/ic
```

### Step 2: Setting up the environment variable

This is needed for the compiler to know where the runtime library is located. This should be set to the root of the repository you just cloned.

```bash
cd ic
export IC_HOME=$(pwd)
```

### Step 3: Building the compiler

```bash
cd $IC_HOME/compiler
cargo build --release
```

Leaves the executable `ic` in `$IC_HOME/compiler/target/release/ic`

### Step 4: Building the runtime library

```bash
cd $IC_HOME/runtime
mkdir lib
cd lib
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j $(nproc)
```

Leaves the static library `libic.a` in `$IC_HOME/runtime/lib/libic.a`

### Step 5: Compiling the program

If the program is called `prog.fl`:

```bash
cd /path/to/program
$IC_HOME/compiler/target/release/ic prog.fl
```

Creates a `_build` subdirectory in the current directory with the generated executable `out` (and the generated C source code `out.c`)

### Step 6: Running the program

```bash
_build/out
```

There are program examples in the `examples/fl` directory.
